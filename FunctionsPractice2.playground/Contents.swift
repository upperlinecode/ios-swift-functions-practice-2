//Functions with parameters

//Make a function called double that takes one integer parameter. Make it return twice the value of the parameter.
//double(3) --> returns 6
//double(20) --> returns 40







//Make a function called repeatThreeTimes that takes in a string parameter and prints that string three times. The first two should be followed by a comma, and the final should be followed by an exclamation point.
//repeatThreeTimes("Banana") --> returns "Banana, Banana, Banana!"
//repeatThreeTimes("That kangaroo is Australian") --> returns "That kangaroo is Australian, That kangaroo is Australian, That kangaroo is Australian!"






//Make a function called pricePlusTax that calculates the price of a product plus 7% sales tax. It should accept a parameter of type Double
//pricePlusTax(1.00) --> returns 1.07
//pricePlusTax(7.15) --> returns 7.65







//A person's max heart rate is approximately 220 minus their age. Define a function called maxHeartRate that takes in a parameter for the age of a person and returns the maximum heart rate for that person.
//maxHeartRate(30) --> 190
//maxHeartRate(17) --> 203






//Make a function called todaysActivities that takes in a string parameter called weather. If it is raining, the function should return 'Staying inside and reading a book.'. If it is sunny, it will return 'Going swimming!'. If it is windy, it will return 'Flying a kite!' If weather contains any other string, it will return 'I don't know, I'll probably play it by ear.'
//todaysActivities("windy") --> "Flying a kite."
//todaysActivities("temperate") --> "I don't know, I'll probably play it by ear."










//Make a function called doesThisStartWithQ that accepts a string as a parameter and returns true if the first letter of the string is 'q' or 'Q' and returns false otherwise.
//doesThisStartWithQ("Bottle Cap") --> false
//doesThisStartWithQ("Quincy") --> true












//Bonus
//More than one parameter
//Make a function called pythagoreanTheorem that takes in two integer parameters for leg1 and leg2 of a right triangle. The function should return the length of the hypotenuse.
//pythagoreanTheorem(3,4) --> 5
//pythagoreanTheorem(6,8) --> 10
